# security.txt

Cross-platform browser extension for discovering security.txt and humans.txt files.

As you browse the web, this extension will check for a [security.txt](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-foudil-securitytxt-08) 
and [humans.txt](http://humanstxt.org) file on each site you visit. If either file exists, an icon (:information_source:) 
will be displayed which you can click to view the files.
